# Ad Banners

This project is a Next.js application enhanced with TypeScript and styled with MUI (Material-UI), designed for displaying and managing advertisement banners. The app features a homepage with a list of ad banners that users can edit through an interactive UI, powered by MUI components for a sleek and modern user experience. Each banner can be customized, and changes are saved locally to ensure persistence across sessions.

## Features

- Display a list of advertisement banners on the homepage, powered by a JSON data structure.

- Users can select from predefined banner images or upload their own images to customize banners further.

- Edit banner details using a bottom sheet interface, with options to modify the title, description, CTA(call-to-action).

- Changes are saved to local storage, allowing persistence of banner details even after a browser reload.

- Users can download the edited banner images, allowing them to save changes locally or use them elsewhere.

- Fully responsive design that adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes.

- Includes a reset button to revert all banners to their original state.
